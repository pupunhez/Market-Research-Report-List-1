<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Damper Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric damper actuators market comprises two main types: spring return damper actuators and non-spring return damper actuators. Spring return actuators utilize a spring mechanism to return the damper to a default position when power is lost, ensuring safety and reliability. In contrast, non-spring return actuators maintain their position without a spring, relying solely on electric power. Both types are critical in HVAC systems to regulate airflow, enhance energy efficiency, and improve indoor climate control.</p></p>
